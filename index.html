  <p>This took me a while.. here are the instructions hopefully they are helpful</p>
  <h3>Learn GIT</h3>
  <p><a href="https://git-scm.com/book/en/v2/Git-Branching-Basic-Branching-and-Merging">This</a> is an excellent resource. The link takes you to as far as I got in the first day I started looking at this.
-requirements: install git, create a new repository in github (hello-git), install vscode, 
-open powershell and then configure git (change master to main, set vscode as the editor, set your name, set your email to the ID+username email from github)
-learn the following by practice: git clone, git add, git commit (-a -am), git push, git pull, git fetch, git rm, git status, git branch, git checkout, git log --decorate

-in github, enable pages on the repository and make changes in vscode

<h3>learn html</h3>
  </p>
learn the tags
-create tables
-create lists
-create links to other pages in the repository eg. about page
-create text field

<label for="fname">First name:</label>
<input type="text" id="fname" name="fname"> 
</p>
   </body>
